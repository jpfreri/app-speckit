# Feature: User Authentication & Session Management

**Feature ID:** 1
**Branch pattern:** `feature/1-user-auth`
**Status:** Ready
**Created:** 2026-09-23
**Input:** Multi-user authentication and session management so each user can sign in and access private todo data
**Related:** [ADR-0001 — Client–server multi-user architecture](../docs/adr/0001-client-server-multi-user-architecture.md), [ADR-0002 — Security architecture](../docs/adr/0002-security-architecture.md)

## User Stories

### US-1.1: Register an account

**As a** new user  
**I want to** create an account with my name, email, username, and password  
**So that** I can sign in and do the activites allowed for my role

**Priority:** P1  
**Independent test:** Submit valid registration and land on protected home with `user` with thier role in `localStorage`  
**Acceptance scenarios:** see ### US-1.1 under Acceptance Criteria

### US-1.2: Sign in

**As a** registered user  
**I want to** sign in with my username and password  
**So that** I can access the application dashboard securely

**Priority:** P1  
**Independent test:** Sign in with known credentials and receive session token + redirect to home  
**Acceptance scenarios:** see ### US-1.2 under Acceptance Criteria

### US-1.3: Stay signed in across page loads

**As a** signed-in user  
**I want** my session to persist in the browser  
**So that** I do not have to sign in again every time I refresh the page

**Priority:** P1  
**Independent test:** Refresh or revisit protected route with valid `localStorage` session — no re-login  
**Acceptance scenarios:** see ### US-1.3 under Acceptance Criteria

### US-1.4: Sign out

**As a** signed-in user  
**I want to** sign out  
**So that** no one else can use my account on a shared device

**Priority:** P2  
**Independent test:** Sign out from `MenuBar` clears server session and `localStorage`; user lands on login  
**Acceptance scenarios:** see ### US-1.4 under Acceptance Criteria

### US-1.5: Block unauthenticated access

**As the** application  
**I want to** require a valid session for all non-auth screens  
**So that** users can only see and modify their own data

**Priority:** P1  
**Independent test:** Navigate to protected route without session → redirect to login; API without token → `401`  
**Acceptance scenarios:** see ### US-1.5 under Acceptance Criteria

### US-1.6: Role-based MenuBar

**As a** signed-in user  
**I want** the `MenuBar` to show **Sign out** and only the nav items allowed for my `role`  
**So that** I can leave the session and I do not see tools for other roles

**Priority:** P1  
**Independent test:** After login, `MenuBar` is visible with **Sign out**; a `student` does not see admin-only items  
**Acceptance scenarios:** see ### US-1.6 under Acceptance Criteria

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Users MUST authenticate with **username** + **password** (not email-only login).
- **FR-002**: Registration MUST collect first name, last name, email, username, and password.
- **FR-003**: Passwords MUST be hashed with **bcrypt** (`SALT_ROUNDS = 10`) before persistence; hashes MUST never be returned by the API.
- **FR-004**: Sessions MUST use a **JWT + Session table** pattern: token stored server-side; client sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- **FR-005**: Session lifetime MUST be **24 hours** from creation.
- **FR-006**: Login MUST reuse a non-expired session for the same user when one already exists.
- **FR-007**: Every authenticated request MUST resolve to exactly one user via `req.user.id` from the session token (foundation for Features 2–3 ownership).
- **FR-008**: Registration MUST use shared `emailRules` from `frontend/src/config/validation.js` — required plus regex (`/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/`); invalid format message: **"Enter a valid email address."**
- **FR-009**: This feature MUST **introduce** `MenuBar` in `App.vue` (`<MenuBar />` above `<v-main>`). `MenuBar` MUST be visible on `login`, `register`, and `home`.
- **FR-010**: `MenuBar` MUST show **Sign out** when a session exists (including if the user is on `login`). When there is no session, **Sign out** MUST be hidden.
- **FR-011**: `MenuBar` nav items MUST be filtered by the signed-in user's `role` field from the `users` table / `localStorage` `user` payload. An item is shown only when `user.role` is in that item's allowed roles. Feature 1 ships **Sign out** (all authenticated roles) and no catalog links; later features add items.

---

## Assumptions

- Greenfield app — no existing users or external identity provider.
- Single browser `localStorage` session per device (no multi-tab sync beyond shared storage).
- League catalog UI is deferred to Feature 3; season catalog is deferred to Feature 2. Feature 1 delivers auth, a minimal protected home, and `MenuBar` (role-based items + **Sign out**).

## Edge Cases

- Duplicate username or email on register → `400` with clear message.
- Invalid login credentials → `401` (same message for wrong username or password).
- Missing or expired token on protected API → `401`; frontend clears session and redirects to login.
- Whitespace-only required fields → rejected (client and/or server).

## Success Criteria

- **SC-001**: Every Gherkin scenario in this feature has at least one automated test before merge.
- **SC-002**: A new user can register, sign in, reach the protected home page, and sign out from `MenuBar` in one manual pass.
- **SC-003**: `npm test` passes with backend auth and frontend router/register/login/`MenuBar` coverage.
- **SC-004**: `MenuBar` is visible on the login page; **Sign out** appears after a session exists and is hidden when there is no session.

---

## Data Ownership & Isolation (foundation)

Feature 1 establishes identity; Features 2–3 enforce per-user data boundaries.

- Each user account is a separate tenant boundary for courses lists and items.
- No API in this feature returns another user's profile or session.
- Later features must never expose lists or todos across users — not in list responses, detail views, or error messages that confirm another user's resource exists.

## API Requirements

| Method | Endpoint            | Auth | Purpose                                 |
| ------ | ------------------- | ---- | --------------------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/courses/register` | No   | Create a new user account               |
| `POST` | `/courses/login`    | No   | Authenticate and return session payload |
| `POST` | `/courses/logout`   | Yes  | Invalidate current session token        |

**Login / register success response** (flat JSON, no envelope):

```json
{
  "userId": 1,
  "username": "jdoe",
  "email": "jdoe@example.com",
  "fName": "Jane",
  "lName": "Doe",
  "role": "manager",
  "token": "<jwt>"
}
```

**Error response:** `{ "message": "Human-readable explanation." }` with appropriate HTTP status.

---

## Screen Requirements

### [View: Login Page] — route name `login`

- Auth form with `MenuBar` visible (this feature introduces `MenuBar`; do not hide it on login).
- Fields: username, password.
- Primary action: **Sign in** (`v-btn`, shows `:loading` while request is in flight).
- Link or button to navigate to registration.
- Inline error via `<v-alert type="error">` on failed login.

### [View: Register Page] — route name `register`

- Auth form with `MenuBar` visible.
- Fields: first name, last name, email, role, username, password, confirm password.
- Email field uses shared `emailRules` from `frontend/src/config/validation.js` (required + regex format).
- Primary action: **Create account**.
- Link or button to navigate to login.
- Client-side validation before API call; server errors shown via `<v-alert type="error">`.

### [View: Home placeholder] — route name `home`

- Minimal protected landing page shown after successful login or registration. This is **not** the seasons list (`/seasons` is Feature 2) or the leagues list (`/leagues` is Feature 3).
- Displays a welcome message using the user's first name.
- No on-page **Sign out** button — sign-out is only in `MenuBar`.

**App chrome**

- **Introduce** `MenuBar` in this feature. Mount it in `App.vue` (`<MenuBar />` above `<v-main>`).
- `MenuBar` is visible on `login`, `register`, and `home` (deviation from hide-on-login in `ui-style-system.mdc`).
- No session: `MenuBar` shows with no catalog items and **no** **Sign out**.
- Session exists: `MenuBar` shows the signed-in user's name, **Sign out**, and only nav items allowed for `user.role`.
- Feature 1 catalog items: none. Later features register items against roles (`admin` → **Seasons** in Feature 2, **Leagues** in Feature 3).

---

## Key Entities

- **User**: registered account (name, email, username, role); owns future lists and todos.
- **Session**: server-side record tying a JWT token to a user; expires after 24 hours.

- `MenuBar` exists in `App.vue`, visible on `login` / `register` / `home`, with **Sign out** when a session exists and items filtered by `user.role`.
- Feature 2 adds **Semesters** (allowed role `admin`) to this `MenuBar`; it MUST NOT create a second `MenuBar`.
- Feature 3 adds **Courses** (allowed role `admin`) to this `MenuBar`.
